# dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I prefer things minimal, modern and colorful.

## Setup

I'm using the excellent [DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage everything so setup is super simple.
Just clone this repository and run its `install` script from your home directory.
You'll need Git and Python installed.
You can copy and paste:

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/hoangp/dotfiles
    dotfiles/install

You should be able to pull all changes by simply rerunning the installer script.

## Customization

I don't provide any hooks for further customization; I think dotfiles should be personal. That being said, I am a big fan of sharing dotfiles and taking inspiration from othersâ€™ configurations. You are welcome to copy parts of my configuration.
